# Matplotlib-Assignment

For this assignment we were required to utalize matplotlib to analyze Pharmaceutical drug tests.
First we organized, merged and cleaned the data sets into a single cleaned version.
Then we were required to make an assortment of graphs using matplot lib to display differing pices of information within the data set.
the grapgh created were
Line
Bar
Pie
Box Plot
Scatter
as well as Scatter with line of regression
once this was completed we had had to find severeal key points that stood out in the data.
These points were then analyzed to prove we could not only utalize the technologies but also understand what information was beging portrayed

completion process I would first attempt to find each of these value using my memory, then i would lookinto the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when i was lost. After doing these steps i would consult ChatGPT to find out where i went wrong and would use its assitance to correct the code as well as explain its proccess to me so i could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid.

Pankaj provided me with assistance when the above steps all failed.
